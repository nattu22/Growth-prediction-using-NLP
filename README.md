# Long-Term-Stock-Price-Growth-Prediction-using-NLP-on-10-K-Financial-Reports
A 10-K FInancial Report is a comprehensive report which must be filed annually by all publicly traded companies about its financial performance. These reports are filed to the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). This is even more detailed than the annual report of a company. The 10K documents contain information about the Business' operations, risk factors, selected financial data, the Management's discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A) and also Financial Statements and supplementary data.  I have been expected to build an NLP pipeline that ingests 10-K reports of various publicly traded companies and build a machine learning model which can uncover the hidden signals to predict the long term stock performance of a company from the 10-K docs using the ‘Loughran McDonald Master Dictionary’. The Dictionary contain words that are specifically curated in the context of financial reports
